      <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Verdana;"><small>Using
the method of User Profiling, (introducted in&nbsp;Unit 8), I constructed a number of user profiles which encouraged
consideration of the&nbsp;extremes of parenting. Combining this with
discussions with other parents and my wife, a professional childminder,
I &nbsp;was able to identify a wide range of users. &nbsp;Parents of
all types and
from all classes;&nbsp;young or old, working or unemployed, stressed or
care-free, &nbsp;busy or under-utilized, able-bodied or disabled in
some form, foreign nationalities, single, married or divorcees, step or
foster parents or even carers. Also parents who deal with looking

disabled children, shy or hyperactive children.</small></div>

      <br>













      </span></small><small>Again taking the lead from Unit 8, I took 2 user-trips through the site, recording
and correcting obvious deficiencies. I also asked my wife and a friend
to take a trip through it and made minor adjustments&nbsp;based on
their experience. Overall I attemped to follow the guidlines on
usability and accessability, while also taking care with colours, font,
images and clear simple text.</small><small><span style="font-style: italic;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></small></span></small></div>

      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">What
interactive features could usefully be added to your site?</span></small></div>

      </ul>



      
      
      
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Verdana;"><small>


Unit 9 gave&nbsp;a good introduction to this, and the ideas of direct
manipulation (for user choice) and form filling would prove a useful
starting point. &nbsp;However,&nbsp;further research and learning would
be needed before I could undertake this task.<br>



      </small></div>



      
      
      
      <ul style="font-family: Verdana;">



        <small>A
feedback sheet would help with continual improvement of the site inline
with user experience. However, more importantly, would be the inclusion
of the facility for direct interaction with other parents, and possibly
with professionals via online appointment booking method or timed
availability for question and answer sessions. This interactivity of an
open chat room for parents, with the availability of confidential
sesssions with professionals, would likely be the site's main
attraction. Although search facilities can prove useful I would not include at this stage, as the site is small and simple.</small>

did you decide the structure of your site?</small><br>







      <small>
          </small><br>






      <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal;"><small>Following
the guidelines in Unit 7 I first drew up a written "requirements
specification" for the site. From this I then summarised the main
information areas, looking at other sites for inspiration, and worked
on organising this information into&nbsp;a hierarachal tree structure,
limiting the depth to 4 levels. On review of Unit 2 I concluded the
tree structure was the best option for this initial outlay. </small>&nbsp;<br>






      <br>






      </span><small>How
did you organise or 'chunk' the information to be put on individual
pages?</small><br>







      <small><br>






      <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal;">Again
Unit 7 proved helpful, in using my&nbsp;initial tree structure to
develop a&nbsp;site diagram on paper, showing the initial ideas of
pages and content, working down from the home page. &nbsp;Overall it
was difficult to seperate the information, but I narrowed it down to 5
main categories, in order to meet the limitation of only 5
additional&nbsp;pages being allowed&nbsp;for the ECA.</span></small><br>






      <small>
      <br>







What
consideration did you give to navigation and usability?</small><br>







      <small><br>






      <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal;"></span></small><span style="font-weight: normal; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><small>Unit
7 taught that a consistent visual appearance for each page would be
essential for usability and navigation. From this I decided that&nbsp;a
logo&nbsp;and a page title on each page would be best, in addition to
the consistent format of each page (layout, colour, images etc) across
the site&nbsp;that I had also picked up from the course material and by
looking at other web sites.&nbsp;<br>








      <br>








In Unit 8, Ex3.3,
the materials author created a site, from which I liked the idea of the
links being on top of the page, as opposed to the side of the page.
&nbsp;With ony&nbsp;5 linked pages for the site I found this would work well for
my site and kept with this, while keeping other useful&nbsp;links to the left panel of each page.<br>






      <br>






I also learnt from Unit 7 that location information was important in
helping the user to identify where they are. &nbsp;With this in mind I
created seperate location links at the top left of each page, which
also accommodated return to the home page from any other page.<br>






      <br>






I considered a site map but decided against it, concluding that the site was too small and simple to need this.<br>








      <br>






      </small></span><small>In
designing the site, what considerations did you give to accessibility?</small><br>







      <small><br>






      <span style="font-weight: normal; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Using
Unit 8 as a guide I have kept the design simple and clear, attempting
to maintain good contrast between background colour and text
throughout, while also keeping images simple and ensuring that they
have associated altenative text to aid screen readers. I have also kept
away from animations and limited scrolling on all sites, using links
and anchors where needed.<br>






      <br>






I attempted to use some of the accessibility checking methods showing
in Unit 8, but found installing the text browser to complicated and the
html references in the validation sites too&nbsp;much for my limited
knowledge. I&nbsp;put the latter part&nbsp;partly down to
the&nbsp;underlying HTML code generated by NVU.<br>






      </span>
      <br>







How
did you develop and test your site?<br>






      <br>






      <span style="font-weight: normal; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I
developed my site using NVU as recommended by the course and tested
through my firefox browser and Internet Explorer. Although there were
some differences with the display in IE I decided not to work on fixing
these as the ECA did not require this.</span></small></div>

      <ul style="font-family: Verdana;">














        <small>Looking at other parental sites the commonality seemed to be a table layout of 2 or 3 columns, a guideline which I followed. </small><br>








        





        





        





        
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      </ul>








      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Verdana;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">How

      <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Verdana;"><small><br>






I positioned the&nbsp;logo top left of each page and the title top
center, in line with the most common layout I perceived on other sites.
As there was only 5 main page links I decided these would look better,
and would provide the best usability, at the&nbsp;top&nbsp;of the page,
as opposed to the side of the page.<br>








      <br>








I then toyed with different uses of
the side columns, concluding that the left bar would be most useful for
other user-centric information, such as exterior links and contacts,
and the right would be best used for the image display.<br>








      <br>








Overall
I concluded that the same layout throughout would keep the simplicity I
aimed for, while&nbsp;improving the navigation and usability of the site.</small> <br>







      <br>







      <small><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">Which
fonts and sizes did you use and why?</span><br>

      <small>



Units 1-3 where useful here, particularly the condensed guidelines and
the information on combining text with images in Unit 1. I didnt want
to stray too far from the recommended font of Verdana, (one of the 10
golden rules of Unit 3),
as I found it to be very&nbsp;readable. &nbsp;However, using it
throughout gave a bland look to the overall site, so I decided to
introduce a&nbsp;'fun' font for the Site Name and the main links at the
top of the page. &nbsp;The font I found worked best was "Kristen ITC",
which I have used, but for the Site's name I opted to&nbsp;create a
graphic
version (via screen dump to paint.exe), for the added reassurance that
its appearance would not change when viewed in other browsers. &nbsp;I
also worked with the idea of changing the links at the top of the page
to graphical alternatives, but this didnt work as well, as this took
away from their hyperlink appearance, detracting from the sites
usability.</small></div>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Verdana;"><br>


      <small>





The intention was to create a relaxed welcoming look, nothing too
serious or overly professional, while also wanting to keep a simplistic
and happy look and feel about it. To this end I choose to keep images
simple, staying away from photos or complex images and keeping
with&nbsp;simple, (humorously) light images. &nbsp;I also&nbsp;wanted
to minimise&nbsp;colourful&nbsp;images to avoid conflict&nbsp;with the
overall colourscheme and warmth of feeling.<br>


      <br>



Unit 5 of the course material provided some excellent advice on the use
of images for web pages, and from this I learnt that the most suitable
format for my simple images, was either&nbsp;GIFF or PNG format.
&nbsp;I eventually opted to save all my images in PNG format, as it
resulted in&nbsp;better quality and smaller file sizes than GIFF.</small>

Parental sites I found simple 2-colour palettes to be the norm, with
orange and green colours appearing common. (provide 2 example sites).
&nbsp;I wanted to keep a warm welcoming feel to the site and with this
in mind kept to a simple , 2-colour,&nbsp;warm palette of orange and
yellow mainly throughout.</small><br>

I found NVU to be easy to use and as a beginner I was able to build a
website fairly quickly using its user friendly interface and relatively
familiar menu structure. Working with images was easy but working with
text was more restricted, with limited range of type size allowed.
Using tables proved frustrating, due to it continually crashing and not
informing of inaction. </span></small><br style="font-family: Verdana;">


      <br style="font-family: Verdana;">


      <small><span style="font-family: Verdana;">


I may continue using to build up experience but would definitely look
for alternative as would like to gain more familiarity with the
HTML.&nbsp; How NVU incorporates or accommodates CSS style sheets, xml,
xhtml or code validation is unclear and I would be interested in
exploring this more.</span></small><span style="font-family: Verdana;">
