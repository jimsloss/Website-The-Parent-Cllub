OU Assignment Building a website

This was the final Assignment for one of the module courses I completed in completing my degree

It was completed in 2009 using NVU, a free HTML editor, around the same time that dreamweaver and Microsoft Expression Web where the main tools to use.
I found this easier for the beginner.

The site is part of the final assessment for the course, and includes a report of my development of the site.

I look back at this now and find it exciting how this area has moved on so much. But also am annoyed by how little my own personal development has moved on, given that this is roughly at the same level as my current knowledge. Aw well, got to keep looking forwards not backwards.
